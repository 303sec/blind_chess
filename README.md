# Blind Chess

This is a project to take Chess PGNs and convert them into natural language, and then turn them into natural-sounding spoken audio using Eleven.ai. I'm also using a script to increase the length of silence between moves.

One interesting feature of this project is that I'm trying to write minimal code for this Proof of concept, and just write prompts to GPT-4 for the code.
